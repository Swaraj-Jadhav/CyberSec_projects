# NIST Cybersecurity Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains the results and documentation for an enterprise-wide cybersecurity assessment conducted using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The assessment evaluates the organization's current cybersecurity posture, identifies gaps, and provides recommendations for improving security across various domains.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a comprehensive guide that helps organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The framework consists of five core functions:

- **Identify**: Understand the organization's risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
- **Protect**: Develop and implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
- **Detect**: Implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
- **Respond**: Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
- **Recover**: Maintain resilience and restore any capabilities or services impaired by cybersecurity events.
